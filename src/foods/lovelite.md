## Review

I tried their mango graham shake once when I was craving dessert after dinner, and it was absolutely delicious! I finished a 60-peso mango graham shake and still wanted more >< I didn't know that the place was popular among students, especially UST students. Now I'm craving it again! They offer a variety of flavors and different types of mango graham, catering to your preferences and budget ^^
