## Tools

- Chopping board
- Knife
- Wooden or plastic spatula
- Iron cast cooking pan or skillet

## Tips

- You can let the dish simmer a bit more so that the flavors will seep into the shrimp. Aside from scallions, you can use fried garlic for garnishing the dish.
- This dish is best when served immediately, and if there are any leftovers it can last up to 2-3 days in the fridge. When it is cooked longer than the recommended time, the shrimp meat's texture can be a bit rubbery.
